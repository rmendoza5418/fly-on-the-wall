[00:00.00s -> 00:04.50s] Okay, let's get started. The main goal today is to decide on the database schema for the user profiles.
[00:04.50s -> 00:09.12s] I think we should stick to PostgreSQL. It handles the relational data we have much better than Mongo.
[00:09.12s -> 00:15.30s] That makes sense, especially for the billing module. However, for the chat logs, maybe we need something faster for writes?
[00:15.30s -> 00:19.45s] We could use Redis for caching the recent messages and then dump them to Postgres for long-term storage.
[00:19.45s -> 00:22.00s] Agreed. Let's go with that hybrid approach.
[00:22.00s -> 00:25.10s] Also, did anyone check the latency issues on the login page?
[00:25.10s -> 00:30.00s] Yes, it was an N+1 query issue. I deployed a fix this morning, and average load time is down to 200ms.
[00:30.00s -> 00:33.20s] Fantastic work. Okay, meeting adjourned.

```markdown
## Meeting Summary

- **Database Decision**: The team agreed to use a hybrid approach: PostgreSQL for user profiles and billing data (due to relational needs) and Redis for caching recent chat logs to optimize write speed.
- **Performance Fix**: The latency issue on the login page was identified as an N+1 query problem; a fix was deployed, reducing load times to 200ms.
- **Action Items**: Proceed with the PostgreSQL + Redis architecture implementation.
